{"@text":"The 1987 FIBA European Championship, commonly called FIBA EuroBasket 1987, was the 25th FIBA EuroBasket regional basketball championship, held by FIBA Europe. It was held in Greece between 3 and 14 June 1987. Twelve national teams entered the event under the auspices of FIBA Europe, the sport's regional governing body. ThePeace and Friendship Stadium in Piraeus was the hosting venue of the tournament. Greece faced up their biggest challenge, as the country was the host of the EuroBasket 1987 and the team enjoyed a formidable line-up. Qualified from the preliminary round, they eliminated Italy and Yugoslavia, both among the favourites to win the tournament, in the quarter-finals and the semi-finals respectively. In the final, Greece faced the defending champions and heavily favoured Soviet Union. In front of 17,000 Greek fans at the Peace and Friendship Stadium, the hosts won the gold medal after a thrilling win 103–101 over the Soviets, with Nikos Galis scoring 40 points. It was the first time that a Greek national team won a major tournament in any sports, thus basketball was made the national team sport overnight and the national team was to be considered the official cherished of the Greek nation. Since then Greece has been placed in the high level on the basketball stage.","@confidence":"0.5","@support":"0","@types":"","@sparql":"","@policy":"whitelist","Resources":[{"@URI":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/FIBA_Europe","@support":"451","@types":"DBpedia:Agent,Schema:Organization,DBpedia:Organisation","@surfaceForm":"FIBA","@offset":"9","@similarityScore":"0.9999318295693416","@percentageOfSecondRank":"6.817507819668394E-5","@abstract":"FIBA Europe is a zone within the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) which includes all 51 national European basketball federations."},{"@URI":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/FIBA_EuroBasket","@support":"902","@types":"DBpedia:Agent,Schema:Organization,DBpedia:Organisation,DBpedia:SportsLeague,DBpedia:BasketballLeague","@surfaceForm":"European Championship","@offset":"14","@similarityScore":"1.0","@percentageOfSecondRank":"5.643928639553654E-16","@abstract":"EuroBasket, previously referred to as the European Basketball Championship, is the main basketball competition contested biennially by the men's national teams governed by FIBA Europe, the European zone within the International Basketball Federation.
